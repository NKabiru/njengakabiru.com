A list of the software and services I use. I'll do my best to keep it updated .

## Editors/IDEs
- [Code - OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) - It's Visual Studio Code, but without Microsoft's license and telemetry. Use it for non-PHP code.
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - for Laravel app development. My go-to tool for refactoring.(Working on phasing it out ðŸ˜Ž) 
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Vim replacement. I'm currently working on configuring it to be my primary editor. 

## Fonts
My primary font changes fairly regularly, so here are some of my favorite:
  - Fira Code - my first editor & terminal font.
  - IBM Plex Mono
  - Cascadia Code
  - Jetbrains Mono (current)

## Terminal
- Konsole - KDE's terminal. The only reason I picked it was because it supported ligatures.
- Zsh - in conjunction with oh-my-zsh. I use the [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) theme.

## Design
- Good ol' pencil and paper for wireframes and sketches.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - wonderful web app. I use the figma-linux desktop app found in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/figma-linux/).

## Services & Apps
- Deezer - one of the music streaming services available in my country.
- Soundcloud - for indie music
- DigitalOcean - for hosting and server stuff
- Bitwarden - free and open-source password manager.
- Authy - two-factor authentication
- Mailspring/Mailspring-libre - email client
- Albert - application launcher 
- Joplin - free & open-source note-taking app. Can be synchronized to Dropbox.
- DBeaver - database manager

## Operating Systems
- Manjaro Xfce - popular Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution. (Too lazy to swap to Arch, but I can't do without the AUR ðŸ™‚)
- Windows - for entertainment usually.
